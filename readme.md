# Bad Time Simulator ("Sans" Fight)
URL: https://neowu1216.github.io/c2-sans-fight/

This project is a clone of the sans fight from [Undertale](http://undertale.com/).
It's cloned from https://github.com/Jcw87/c2-sans-fight
It was made with [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2), which I have no idea with... GG I only modify some in game files in gh-pages branch



NOW AVAILABLE! [Custom attacks guide](Documentation/README.MD)
-----------------------------------------------------

Known Issues
------------
- Heart hitbox is probably not accurate.
- On the sans_platforms4 and sans_platforms4hard attacks, the platform is supposed to accelerate from 0 to its full speed, but I was lazy and started it at full speed immediately. This is only a problem if you try to dodge the bones without jumping.
- Sans dialog is missing. I may add something at some future date, but I have no intention of putting the original text in, as it really only makes sense in the context of the whole game.
